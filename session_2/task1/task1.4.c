 * You have to decide which type of loop (for, while, do...while) to use.
 * Write a C program to display a menu and then ask the user to enter 
 * an option. If 0 is entered, the program terminates.
 * Menu options are:
 * 1 - Coffee
 * 2 - Tea
 * 3 - Cold drinks
 * 0 - to quit
 * When 1 is entered, print "You selected Coffee" and then redisplay the menu.
 * The same applies to other options except 0. When 0 is entered, the program terminates.
